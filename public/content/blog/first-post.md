# The Start

When I first started my journey into Deep Learning, I never imagined how fascinating this field would be. In this post, I'll share my experiences and some valuable lessons I've learned while building my from scratch Neural Network with just Numpy and Maths.

## Why From Scratch?

I know we can use various big and heavy lifting, as well as fully optimized Libraries like Pytorch, keras or tensorflow to build neural networks with few lines of code.I used to do that as well in my starter projects, but soon i realized i donot actually understand a good 60-70% of the code i am writing. Whether its ,

```tsx
torch.tensor();
loss.backwards();
tf.constant();
model.fit();
```

I know why we do it, i knew what is happening on the surface, but i didn't know what's happening **behind the scenes**. So to understand what underlying mathematical principles are making these magical black boxes crazy good at doing something. Here are my main goals for this series as well for this project:

- **Maths**: Understand as much as math I can to know the How.
- **Optimization**: To understand how these systems can and are optimized whether its speed or memory efficieny
- **Control**: To understand why we do something, i think the best method is to make a mistake, and i think the more control you have the more mistakes you can make.

## My WorkFlow

I primarily learned the maths and the architecture, starting from:

- what is a single Neuron
- how weights and Biases work and why
- Why we add Non-Linearity or simply Non-Linear functions for activation
- What the heck is Backward-Propagation and much more.

The development part was amazing as well, I learned how to effectively use numpy, from using simple for loops to using np.dot() for optimization.

## Where I Am Now?

This is the start of series "Deep Learning From Scratch", and this Neural Network from Scratch Project is just the 1st step. I aim to build more and more complex stuff in the future going all the way up to Gpt-2.

## Resources

Here are some great resources I've found helpfull:

- [Just Maths: 3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)

## What's Next?

I'm currently working on several exciting projects, like a RAG App,DeepLearning From Scratch Series, kaggle Competitions, etc. You can track them out in my [X](https://x.com/realnarayan_) handle.
